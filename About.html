                Hi! I’m JAYAKRISHNAN. I’m a student at MACFAST.

I’ve been working on my portfolio since high school, but now it’s time to show the world what I’ve got. And that’s why I’ve created this website—so you can see my work so far and get a sense of who I am as an Engineer.

If you’d like to learn more about me, contact me. You can also follow me on social media at @jkrishnan_jk.
